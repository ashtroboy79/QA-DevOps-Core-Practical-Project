# QA-DevOps-Core-Practical-Project
## Encounter Generator
### By Ahsan Rasul

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create and deploy a containerised app using atleast 4 microservices that will work together.  
* Service 1 will be the front-end and will allow users to interact with the application. It will communicate with the other 3 services.
* Service 2 & 3 will be responsible for generate some form of random object, and sending them to service 1
* Service 4 will recieve the two random objects generated by services 2 & 3 and sent to it by service 1, it will then use this data to procedurally generate a response, and send it back to service 1.

## Tech stack

The requirements of the project lead to the following tech stack.
* A Kanban board, for this I am using [Jira](https://rasul-ahsan.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/QCDPP/boards/1), with multiple sprints
* Python for the coding, together with Jinja for templating as necessary
* Version Control will be Git with Github used as the remote repository
* Jenkins will be used as the CI and CD server, and it will utilise a webhook so that any push to the main branch will initiate rebuilding and redoployment of the changed application.
* The application will consist of atleast 4 microservices
* Docker will be used for containerisation, and Docker Swarm will be the Orchistration tool
* Ansible will be used as a configuration manager.
* NGINX will be used as a reverse proxy

## Project Design

The Key user story for the application was "As a DM i would like to randomly generate monsters for my party to encounter".  This gave the following service relationship diagram, as I decided what each service would do.

And the following Kanban board was created for sprint 1

And this is the basic risk assessment, once again something that I find hard considering my lack of experience.

* Service 1 (front-end)- will display a webpage through which the user will interact with the application, onload or refresh the app will make a number of HTTP requests to services 2, 3, & 4. It will make a GET request to services 2 & 3, then using the responses it will then make a POST request to service 4, and then display the response from service 4. Initially the service needed the reload this page button on the browser to be pressed inorder to display a different encounter, so I decided to add a small button that the user could click to get another encounter.

* Service 2 (monster species) - upon recieving a GET request, it will use the choice method from random, to randomly select from a list of monster species.

* Service 3 (monster type) - is the simplest of the services simply using randint from random, to return a value between 1 and 6 upon recieving a GET request, as monster type. Initially the service cast the return value to a string, but I decided to use JSON instead for clarity of what the return should and to make implementation of service 4 simpler.

* Service 4 (monster class) - will recieve a POST request, containing both monster species and monster type, as JSON. It will then use both these values to traverse a dictionary containing a list of unique monster classifications. The monster species will be used as the key to find the appropriate list, and the integer from service 3 is used for the index in the list.  Then depending on the value generated, conditionals are used to generate the appropriate response string, whcich is sent back to Service 1.  This service led to a bug and required the conditionals to be rewritten as detailed in the Issues and Bugs section.

As I implemented the services, I decided that I would like to incorporate and external api to retrieve data on the monster to be dispayed, unfortunately the only external [d&d api](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs/#get-/api/monsters/-index-) did not include most of the monsters I had selected to be used, and as such it did not make it into version 1 of the application. 

Finally a fifth service consisting of a nginx reverse proxy is used, this alowed traffic on port 80 to be redirected to port 5000 on the front end service.  This can help protect the application from unwelcome connections to the application.

## Deployment

<p align="center">

</p>

Here we can see all the steps of the deployment pipline. Firstly the developer pushes code to the code repository (step 1), in my case [Github](https://github.com/ashtroboy79/QA-DevOps-Core-Practical-Project), this causes a Webhook to sent a POST request to the Jenkins server (step 2) , this machine needs to have docker, docker compose and ansible installed. The Jenkinsfile is then used to run the pipeline, firsts the tests are run to ensure that the code is still functional (step 3), next the images of the applications are built using docker compose (step 4), and pushed to an external image repository, in this case Docker Hub (step 5). Next the ansible playbook is run, this will install docker onto the host machines and initialise a swarm (step 6), an ansible playbook should be idempotent, meaning that it should be able to be run multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application, thus allowing it to be run multiple times without causing unintended effects. For this application this means that once the swarm is set up the ansible playbook should not change anything about its structure. Lastly the swarm manager will pull the images from docker hub and deploy the swarm as specified in the docker-compose.yaml (step 7). We can see the app services running on the manager and worker below, and the app frontpage in the following images.

## Feature branch

Git and Github allow the use of branching, this was used to keep the code base stable. The development branch was used, and then this was branched off to develop different features, once I was happy with the feature this would be merged back with the development branch. Once the initial app was complete and was checked using docker-compose, the code was pushed to the main branch. The main branch can then be branched off for further development.  

## Test Results

## Further Development

As stated earlier I had hoped to incorporate an external api into the application, as such when designing the next version, I checked the api to see what resources it could provide and what items I could call it on. As such the current version on the dev branch has the following interactions as per the following service relationship diagram.

## Issues and Bugs

Bug fix - ended up with a bug becuase the beholder array only had 5 items not 6, this lead to trying to write more tests to check this, this led me to discovering that python does not like multiple or statements, or atleast the way i had written them in the if statements meant that the new tests werent passing, as such the conditional for these was changed from 

    if x == (a or b or c) 
    to 
    if x in (a, b,c)

GCP seems to have issues with running more than 1 instance of each service, using replicas caused issues, currently uncertain how to solve. This seems to no longer be an issue as I have been able to run the app with 2 replicas.  Also even though the swarm-worker is running services, when I attempt to visit the app on the swarm-worker, i end up with This site canâ€™t be reached The connection was reset. Upon further inspection it turns out that if service1 is on the worker then it fails to return data to the nginx on the manager, all other traffic between the app is bi-directional. This is the case even with the network explictly set to an overlay network, which allows containers on different hosts to communicate with each other, as per the diagram below.  Even with support no solution or reason has been found as of 05/07/22.


## Future Development

Add a load balancer
Deploy with Gunicorn rather than as a native flask app
Add a SQL to store any previous encounters
